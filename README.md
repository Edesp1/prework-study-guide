Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation is being able to make websites for my parents buisiness and maintain websites for larger corporations if my skill level allows me to.
- I built this webpage to help me further understand how web developing works and to write notes to further help me understand what I am doing.

## Usage

The prework study guide can be used to help me learn in depth about how code works in certain scenarios and how even a small mistake like missing a parenthesis will ruin the code entirely. Learned how HTML builds a website but needs CSS to style it and give the website its features necessary for viewers to know what the webpage is about. Also learned how we can use the inspect element console on the browser to see how javascript runs like listing topics just like how i made in this website. Finally how Git is a fundamental piece to help in any coding project be it making softwares,webpages or even engineering.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
